# Competetive Programming

Competitive programming involves programmers competing against each other to solve programming questions in a limited amount of time. These events are usually held over the Internet or a local network. The contestants of the events are known as sport programmers.

The questions are for **`your practice`**. So, everyone should solve them and we will be having a **`contest on 8th of April`** which will be **`considered for evaluation`**.You don't need to submit the solution, just practice them on your own. If you have any queries, ask in discord channel.
