# Video Editing

Welcome to the domain of video editing.

## Getting Started

If you're new to video editing, there are a few things you'll need to get started:

- A computer with video editing software installed
- Raw footage from a camera or other device
- A basic understanding of video editing techniques

Use editing softwares such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and Davinci Resolve. It's important to choose a software that fits your needs and budget. We prefer **`Premiere pro`** and **`After Effects`** editors but you can use any software you like.

## Tips and Techniques

Here are a few tips and techniques for editing videos:

- Start with a plan: Before you begin editing, create a storyboard or shot list to guide your editing process.
- Cut on action: When making cuts, try to cut on movement or action to create a smooth transition.
- Use transitions sparingly: While transitions can be a fun way to add visual interest, overusing them can be distracting. You can use transitions like zoom, pan, lighleak etc.
- Use audio to guide your edits: Pay attention to the audio in your footage to help you make cuts and transitions that sync with the music or dialogue.
- Keep it simple: It's tempting to add a lot of effects and transitions, but often a simple edit is more effective.
