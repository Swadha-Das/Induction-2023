                <h1>About Me!</h1>
                <p>I am Animesh Pattnaik, a Computer Science Student studying in VSSUT. I am from Berhampur.
                I have completed my matriculation and intermediate from Sankalp Senior Secondary School, Berhampur.
                I enjoy spending time outdoors, playing sports and spending time with my family and friends.
                I also have deep passion for coding and i am always eager to learn more and expand my horizons.
                When it comes to my future goals, I'm still exploring my options and figuring out what path I want to take. 
                I know that I want to pursue a career that allows me to use my skills and strengths to make a positive 
                impact on the world around me. Whether that's through science, technology, art, or something else entirely,
                I'm excited to explore my options and see where my journey takes me.

                <h1>My Interests!</h1>
                <p>My hobbies include nature photography, sketching, writig poems, and skating.
                   I have known skating since class 2 and it has become one of my favourite passtime. 
                   Sketching allows me to express myself in a way that only i can understand so it acts like an outlet for me.
                   Photography has turned into another passion for me as i can't seem to control myself whenever i see some 
                   beautiful view. I started my journey into writing when i was in class 9th, although in the begginning 
                   my writing not something to be proud off, slowly with time they have become pretty good</p>
